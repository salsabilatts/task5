# üõçÔ∏è Vue Product Display (Task 5 - project-based virtual intern)

This is a simple Vue.js project that fetches product data from [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) and displays it based on category: **Men's Clothing**, **Women's Clothing**, or **Unavailable Product**.

Each category section has different styles including layout colors, button themes, and product name styling. When a product is unavailable, a custom layout is shown with a background image and centered overlay text.
